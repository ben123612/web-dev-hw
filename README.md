# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Benjamin Sparrow
During the 2017 fall semester I took an Intro to Programming class where we briefly touched on web design. I thought this class would be interesting and beneficial for further knowledge into this.

### A few things I learned
-I learned that IP addresses are used to seperate what information goes to what computer, when there are multiple computers obtaining information from the internet through a single router.

-I also learned the difference between a website and a web browser.
