  # work flow for assignment8

  **PADDING, MARGINS AND BORDERS**
   - Borders put a specified visual thickness around an object. Padding is the amount of space from one object to another. Margins are the space between one element and another element, such as a parent element.

   **This weeks work cycle**
   -All I can say for this weeks assignment was that it was a challenge and
   I struggled to complete the requirements for the assignment.
