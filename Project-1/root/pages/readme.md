# This is my readme for Project-1

**Browsers**-When I surf the web I usually use google Chrome or Safari. When on a computer I use Google Chrome and on my iPhone I use Safari.
Browsers are a computer program that read Html, CSS and Javascript files and turn them into the visually pleasing websites that we see.

**The Wayback Machine**-I used the Wayback Machine to go back and look at Google in
it's early stages. It was similar to the Google we would see today, however the logo
and text was a bit more pixelated. Google today also updates their logo with different creative fonts/art which I did not see.

**Work Cycle**-This week I built a simple website from scratch using HTML format. I changed the background color of my screen by imbedding the code within
 the "body" tag. I wrote my favorite poem and styled it by using the "pre" tag, which allowed my to add
breaks and have the text show up as written in Atom. I chose to use the "center" tag to make all of the text appear uniformly in the center of the webpage.
I linked both an image of the book my favorite poem is from and this readme file. I had a few issues linking the image but figured out there was a small error with my syntax, once
I corrected the spelling the image linked perfectly.
